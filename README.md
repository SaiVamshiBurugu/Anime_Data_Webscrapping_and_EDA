# 🎌 Anime Data Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves scraping anime-related data from the web, cleaning and analysing it using **Python**. It explores trends in anime production, genres, ratings, and adaptations — revealing patterns in the anime industry through data visualisation and insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🌐 **Web Scraped** anime data from a reliable source using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- 🧹 **Cleaned and structured** the dataset using `Pandas` and exported it in `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats.
- 📊 Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about:
  - Most frequent genres
  - Most active studios and producers
  - Ratings and popularity trends
  - Adaptation types (e.g. Manga, Light Novel, Original)
  - Yearly growth of anime releases
- 📈 Created visualisations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- 📑 Final results were presented as a PowerPoint report (`Project_Report_EDA_.pptx`).
