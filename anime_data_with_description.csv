Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,4.53 Masterpiece,BONES Inc.,Manga,Adventure,~25min,TV-Series,64,2009,"The brothers and alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric made a terrible mistake when they were young: When a strictly forbidden transmutation goes wrong, Edward loses a leg. His brother is hit even worse. Edward can only save him by sacrificing his own arm in an equivalent exchange and binding Alphonse’ soul to a piece of armour. His body, however, seems lost. A much too high price that the two of them had to pay for their recklessness. That’s why they try everything to get their old bodies back. In their aim to achieve the best research conditions in the field of alchemy, their path eventually leads them to the army of Amestris. The military dictatorship of the country uses so-called State Alchemists as elite fighters in wars and conflicts. In times of peace, however, the “lackeys of the army” are free to research as they wish and have access to extensive records on alchemy, as well as financial support. But soon the Elric brothers realise that their own problems are almost insignificant compared to the threat facing the land of Amestris …  Annotation: “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” is the second anime adaptation of the manga of the same name by Hiromu Arakawa. However, it is not a sequel to the anime from 2003, but rather a retelling of the story of the Elric brothers that follows the manga much more closely than the first anime adaptation."

Both discuss school and become closer to each other. Is this the beginning of a great love affair?"

Six years since the end of the Great War, four years since women were allowed to join political associations, and one year since Emperor Hirohito assumed the throne. Japan is a nation re-inventing itself, swept by wave after wave of wars, disasters and political unrest. War looms in China, males over the age of 24 are about to receive the right to vote, and a strange new type of school uniform called the “sailor suit” is being introduced. But at least the national pastime, baseball, remains bound by tradition, the exclusive realm of men and boys – until now.  When a local player arrogantly states that girls should become housewives instead of going to school, teenage firebrands Koume and Akiko respond by forming their own baseball team. It’s shocking. It’s scandalous. And yet, in a nation in which almost anything seems suddenly possible, it may just be the start of something greater than any nine girls can imagine."

Young Umi wants to follow in his big brother’s footsteps and become a basketball player himself, though his prosthetic leg makes that virtually impossible. Ren, however, takes notice of Umi because he is pretty good at throwing and decides to introduce him to wheelchair basketball.

Handball is a thing of the past, but when he watches a video of a 100-metre runner with a prosthetic leg, he takes it to heart. After surviving rehabilitation, however, he gets his first setback: his current running time is anything but record-breaking.  During the third story arc, Ren Narita is assigned to coach a goalball team. So far, only two players have signed up, even though a team must consist of three players. Ren convinces Emi, a girl with normal vision, to become the team’s manager. Just before a game, of all things, Ren “accidentally” suffers from stomach cramps, so Emi has to play – blindfolded.

However, his previously rather boring life changes abruptly after his alcoholic grandfather, the eccentric and emotionally broken scientist Rick, moves in with his parents and begins to take him on his numerous intergalactic journeys. After all, Morty’s simple brainwaves serve as a disguise for Rick, and the boy enables him to reconnect with his family in his old age, which includes Morty’s equally alcoholic mother, Beth, Rick’s sociopathic 17-year-old granddaughter Summer and her notoriously unemployed father, Jerry.

Whether it’s relaxing between multiverses, fighting against an evil organisation with a clone of Beth who has become a space rebel or rescuing Morty from tragicomic love affairs – the two of them rarely get bored!"
